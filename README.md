# privatepup
An anonimized version of puppy linux. PrivatePup has Tor and I2P built in with Privoxy configured for extra security and privacy. All traffic flows through Tor or I2P even curl and wget. No more extenensions needed for browser to change networks. Privatepup routes traffic seemlessly behind the scences. Over 1 million bad actor sites are auto block along with pesty ads within the friendly user interface of puppy. Privatepup has a suite of battle tested and hardened packages centered around privacy and security. To keep connections properly monitored Privatepup uses snort with ip tables already in place to drop nasty nodes. PrivatePup comes with a desposable VM built in..Hows that for cool.There is a new pup on the block and its name is PrivatePup:)
